          Who Am I?
        </h3>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I’ve been a Product  Designer at Hudl for 6+ years. I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects — web, mobile, design systems, design ops, user research, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">The product and the company have grown a lot since I started. We now have around 800 people across many continents. When I started it was closer to 50. So I’ve had the opportunity to experience all that goes with that kind of gowth.
        </p>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">Despite that growth, I’m interested in a new environment with new challenges and new people to learn from.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="vox-content__heading text-expanded--md">
          Why Am I Applying?
        </h3>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I’ll be honest. I rushed to finish my portfolio once I saw this job posting. I’ve been dragging by feet on my portfolio for a while now, and I wasn’t actively looking for a new job. But once I saw this job posting I rushed (eeek) to get my portfolio presentable (it's not even responsive, eeek). Here’s why…

        <h4 class="vox-conetnt__subheading">
          The Company
        </h4>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I’m a Vox consumer, everything from the explainer videos on YouTube, to the Netflix Series, to Vox.com, to The Verge, and on and on. I really believe in the content, the approach, and the quality. I think this is the best example of the model for new media that’s out there.
        </p>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I even learned Rails by building a Remote Job board.</p>
        <h4 class="vox-conetnt__subheading">
          The Team
        </h4>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I did some research about the product team and I got really excited to learn. I watched Yesenia’s talks about design systems (wish I could have gone to Clarity). I followed Mandy’s work going back to Editorially. And I saw that Ethan recently joined the team as well.
        </p>
        <h4 class="vox-conetnt__subheading">
          The Remote Work
        </h4>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I’ve been working remotely for 8+ years. I was the first official remote hire at Hudl when I started. I love it and I really believe in distrubuted teams. It’s not without challenges, but there are huge benefits as well.

        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">I even learned Rails by building a Remote Job board.</p>
        <h4 class="vox-conetnt__subheading">
          The Industry
        </h4>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">In a previous life (right out of college) I started a software company and one of our primary products was a CMS for Alt-Weekly newspapers. So this industry has always been something I’ve had an interest and affinity for. Because of that I can appreciate the finer points of journalism and techology and the modern media climate.
        </p>
        <h4 class="vox-conetnt__subheading">
          The Opportunity
        </h4>
        <p class="vox-content__body text-expanded--md">There seems to be a lot of design challenges with buiding a CMS that has this broad of a set of needs and potential impact, and it’s something that I find very exciting.
