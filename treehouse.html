          Who Am I?
        </h3>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Most recently Iâ€™ve been a Product Designer at <a href="https://www.hudl.com" class="link">Hudl</a>. I've been there for 6+ years where Iâ€™ve worked on a wide variety of projects â€” web, mobile, design systems, design ops, user research, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">The product and the company have grown a lot since I started. When I started we had around 50 people, now there are almost 1k people across many continents. This has given me the opportunity to experience all that goes with that kind of gowth.
        </p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Despite all that, Iâ€™m now interested in a new environment with new challenges and new people to learn from.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="treehouse-content__heading text-expanded--md">
          Why Am I Applying?
        </h3>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Iâ€™ll be honest. I rushed to finish my portfolio once I saw this job posting. Iâ€™ve been dragging my feet on my portfolio site for a while now, and I wasnâ€™t actively looking for a new job. But once I saw this job posting I rushed (ðŸ˜¬) to get my portfolio presentable. Hereâ€™s whyâ€¦
        </p>
        <h4 class="treehouse-conetnt__subheading">
          The Company
        </h4>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Iâ€™m a treehouse consumer. Everything from the explainer videos on YouTube, to the Netflix Series, to treehouse.com, to The Verge, and on and on. I really believe in the content, the approach, and the quality. I think this is the best example of a model for new media thatâ€™s out there.
        </p>
        <h4 class="treehouse-conetnt__subheading">
          The Team
        </h4>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">I did some research about the product team and I got really excited about the dynamic. I watched Yesenia Perez-Cruzâ€™s talks about design systems, I've followed Mandy Brownâ€™s work going back to Editorially, and I also saw that Ethan Marcotte recently joined the team as well. I'd love to learn from this group and contribute where my strengths lie.
        </p>
        <h4 class="treehouse-conetnt__subheading">
          The Remote Work
        </h4>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Iâ€™ve been working remotely for 8+ years. I was the first official remote hire at Hudl when I started and they now have dozens of remote workers. I love it and I really believe in distrubuted teams. Itâ€™s not without challenges, but there are huge benefits as well.
        </p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">I even learned Rails to build a site and job board about remote work.</p>
        <h4 class="treehouse-conetnt__subheading">
          The Industry
        </h4>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">In a previous life (right out of college) I started a software company and one of our primary products was a CMS for Alt-Weekly newspapers. So this industry has always been something Iâ€™ve had an interest and affinity for. Because of that I can appreciate the finer points of journalism and techology and the modern media climate.
        </p>
        <h4 class="treehouse-conetnt__subheading">
          The Opportunity
        </h4>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">I don't know a ton about the day-to-day scope of the work beyond the job posting, but I'd love to learn more. It seems like a really good fit and there are obviously a lot of design challenges with buiding a CMS that has this broad of a set of needs and potential impact. Itâ€™s an opportunity that I find very exciting.
