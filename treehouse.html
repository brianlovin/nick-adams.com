          Who Am I?
        </h3>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Most recently I’ve been a Product Designer at <a href="https://www.hudl.com" class="link">Hudl</a>. I've been there for 6+ years where I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects — web, mobile, design systems, design ops, user research, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">The product and the company have grown a lot since I started. When I started we had around 50 people, now there are almost 1k people across many continents. This has given me the opportunity to experience all that goes with that kind of gowth.
        </p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">Despite all that, I’m now interested in a new environment with new challenges and new people to learn from.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="treehouse-content__heading text-expanded--md">
          Why Am I Applying?
        </h3>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">There is the selfish reason and the more important reason.</p>        
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">For selfish reasons, I'm looking for a new team, new environment, and a new set of design challenges. I've been at my current job for over 6 years and it's a much different company now than it was when I started. I think it's time to explore what's out there so I can get better as a designer in the ways that I'd like.</p>        
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">The more important reason I want to work at Treehouse is because of the larger mission. Working somewhere where you believe in what you're doing is the goal for anyone. I'm not going to say I know the complete details of what Treehouse believes in, but from the outside, it seems aligned with what I believe in.</p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">This is especially true when it comes to disrupting higher education and creating better opportunities for people to build skills and careers outside of that system. In my opinion the current system works for the profits of the institutions, not potential of the students. The entire framing of higher education is as an experience, not as a tool to build a career. It's expensive, exclusive, and out of reach for many &mdash; and for those that do operate within it, they are often left with mountains of debt. Myself included.</p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">This completely changes your life in the workplace after graduation. With mountains of student loan debt, an entire generation is kept on their heels while corporations squeeze more and more from them because they know they have those loans to pay back.</p>
        <p class="treehouse-content__body text-expanded--md">These dynamics are troubling. Democratizing access to the skills that can build careers, without needing to spend tens of thousands to get them, is one way to fight that.</p>
