    <p>I've worked on many things in many capacities, but in all those situations my role was basically: Designer.

Sure, technically I’ve done Interactive, UI, and Product design, but to me it's all just Design. It's the task of understanding a problem, coming up with a solution, and seeing it through to completion.  

Each problem requires a different approach, but for the most part I try to balance the needs of the business, leverage the appropriate technology or optimize a particular system, and always ensure I’m helping a human being solve a clear problem to make their life just a little bit better. 

If I do all of the above extrememly well – if it works well and feels well and is clear and understandable, I’ve done my job as a Designer.
