      <p class="about__body text--md">
          I've worked on many things in many capacities, but in all those situations my role was basically: Designer.
      </p>
      <p class="about__body text--md">
          Sure, technically you could call what I've done Interactive Design, UI Design, and Product Design, but to me it's simply, Design. It's the task of understanding a problem, devising a solution, and seeing it through to completion.  
      </p>
      <p class="about__body text--md">
          Each problem requires a different approach, but for the most part I try to balance the needs of the business, leverage the appropriate technology, optimize the supporting system, and always ensure I'm helping a human being solve a problem &mdash; making their life just a little bit better in the process. 
      </p>
      <p class="about__body text--md">
          If I do all of the above well &mdash; if it works great and feels right and is clear and understandable &mdash; I've done my job as a Designer.
      </p>
